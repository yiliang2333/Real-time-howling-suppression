#Real-time-howling-suppression
## Description: 
Basically, this app repo is a algorithm model **using matlab simulink**. It contains sevral methods to detect and suppress howling noise in real time.
* NHS - Notchfilter howling suppression
* SFM - Spectrum flatness method

You can choose your audio input(Audio Device Reader in simulink) and output (Audio Device Writer in simulink) and run the algorithm to achieve howling detection and howling suppression in real-time.
